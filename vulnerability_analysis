        Empire: PowerShell-based post-exploitation framework.

    Vulnerability databases:
        CVE: Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures database. Contains a list of publicly known cybersecurity vulnerabilities and exposures.
        NVD: National Vulnerability Database. A US government repository of publicly known cybersecurity vulnerabilities and exposures.

    Fuzzing:
        AFL: American Fuzzy Lop. A fuzzer that uses a genetic algorithm to find input values that trigger crashes in software.
        Peach Fuzzer: A general purpose fuzzer that supports multiple input types and protocols.

    Password cracking:
        John the Ripper: Password cracking tool that can crack various types of hashes.
        Hashcat: Advanced password cracking tool that can use GPU acceleration to increase speed.

    Web application scanning:
        OWASP ZAP: A web application security scanner that can identify vulnerabilities such as cross-site scripting (XSS) and SQL injection.
        Burp Suite: A web application security scanner and penetration testing tool.

    Social engineering:

            Vulnerability scanning:

        nmap -sV --script=vuln 192.168.1.1: Scan for known vulnerabilities on a host. This performs a version scan (-sV) and runs the vuln NSE script to identify known vulnerabilities.

        To use this command, replace "192.168.1.1" with the IP address of the host you want to scan.

        openvas-setup: Set up OpenVAS vulnerability scanner.

        To use this command, simply run it in the terminal and follow the prompts to set up OpenVAS.

        openvas-start: Start OpenVAS scanner.

        To use this command, simply run it in the terminal to start the OpenVAS scanner.

        openvas-cli: Command line interface to OpenVAS scanner.

        To use this command, run it in the terminal followed by the desired options and parameters.

    Exploit frameworks:

        Metasploit: Framework for developing, testing, and executing exploits against remote hosts. It includes a database of known vulnerabilities and corresponding exploits.

        To use Metasploit, launch it from the Kali Linux menu or type "msfconsole" in the terminal. You can then use various commands and modules to scan for vulnerabilities and execute exploits.

        Armitage: GUI front-end for Metasploit that allows for easier management of exploits and attacks.

        To use Armitage, launch it from the Kali Linux menu or type "armitage" in the terminal. You can then use its graphical interface to manage exploits and attacks.

        Empire: PowerShell-based post-exploitation framework.

        To use Empire, launch it from the Kali Linux menu or type "empire" in the terminal. You can then use various commands and modules to execute post-exploitation tasks.

    Vulnerability databases:

        CVE: Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures database. Contains a list of publicly known cybersecurity vulnerabilities and exposures.

        To use CVE, visit the CVE website (https://cve.mitre.org/) and search for the desired vulnerability.

        NVD: National Vulnerability Database. A US government repository of publicly known cybersecurity vulnerabilities and exposures.

        To use NVD, visit the NVD website (https://nvd.nist.gov/) and search for the desired vulnerability.

    Fuzzing:

        AFL: American Fuzzy Lop. A fuzzer that uses a genetic algorithm to find input values that trigger crashes in software.

        To use AFL, you need to install it on your system and then use its command line interface to specify the target binary and input file.

        Peach Fuzzer: A general purpose fuzzer that supports multiple input types and protocols.

        To use Peach Fuzzer, you need to create a Peach Pit file that specifies the target application and input file, and then run Peach Fuzzer with the Peach Pit file.

    Password cracking:

        John the Ripper: Password cracking tool that can crack various types of hashes.

        To use John the Ripper, you need to provide it with the hash file and a wordlist to use for cracking.

        Hashcat: Advanced password cracking tool that can use GPU acceleration to increase speed.

        To use Hashcat, you need to provide it with the hash file, a wordlist or rule file, and specify the type of hash to crack.

    Web application scanning:
        OWASP ZAP: A web application security scanner that can identify vulnerabilities such as cross-site scripting (XSS) and SQL
